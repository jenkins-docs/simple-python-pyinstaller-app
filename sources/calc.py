'''
The 'calc' library contains the 'add2' function that takes 2 values and adds
them together. If either value is a string (or both of them are) 'add2' ensures
they are both strings, thereby resulting in a concatenated result.
NOTE: If a value submitted to the 'add2' function is a float, it must be done so
in quotes (i.e. as a string).
